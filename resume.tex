\section{\mysidestyle About me}
I come from the small city of Jakobstad in the mid west of Finland from which I moved to Turku to study computer engineering in 2006.
I completed my Master's degree in 5 years (2006 -- 2011) and my PhD in 4 years (2011 -- 2015) from \AA{}bo Akademi University in Turku, Finland.

\hspace{-2.0cm} \textit{Technical}\\
I have worked extensively in the areas of embedded systems, runtime systems, power management and many-core platforms, which includes foremost low level system programming (usually in C). 
Furthermore I have experience in object oriented programming languages, mostly C++ and Java, and I have of course stumbled upon some Python, VB, Java script, xml and assembly progamming.
I have worked with system modeling, mathematical optimization and control theory including NLP optimization, digital filtering, plane fitting methods, control theory and its underlying mathematics. 
This means that I have very good knowledge of Matlab, its toolboxes and system simulation in Simulink.
On the hardware side, I have excellent knowledge of ARM and Intel platforms in particular, and system/kernel programming using Linux. 
I have been hacking with the Linux kernel since I was 16 years old and know this world in and out.
From my PhD work, I created an Android app called ``Low Energy Player'' freely available on Google Play.
On further lower level I have worked with real-time operating systems like FreeRTOS during my PhD and I have also build many hobby projects from scratch using micro controllers such as an audio synthesizer complete with a midi interface and USB driver running on an 8-bit AVR.
\clearpage

\hspace{-2.0cm} \textit{Project Work}\\
In the 4 years of making my PhD I have published over 15 international peer reviewed scientific articles, one of which I received the best paper award for in 2014. 
I worked in the European FP-7 project RECOMP from 2011 -- 2014 and in the national Tekes project ParallaX from 2014 -- 2016, in which I worked together with universities and
international IT companies like Wittenstein ltd., UK and Seven Solutions, Spain on programming and integration tasks.
I am a very good team worker, which has shown in co-operations with 7 different universities in 4 countries during this time for my thesis, and outside of my thesis I have published work together with 12 different institutions and co-authored work together with over 30 people.
I have visited more than 30 countries in my thesis work, and I find it very easy to join a team and start working on new projects with new people. 

\hspace{-2.0cm} \textit{Languages}
\quad \qquad \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{flags.png}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Swedish: Mother tongue 
 \item Finnish: Conversational
 \item English: Fluent
 \item German: Conversational
\end{itemize}
\hspace{-2.0cm} \textit{Pedagogics}\\
Education wise, I have been lecturing university courses in English since 2013 and completed university pedagogics as a minor subject.
I created an online education MooC on coursera.org from scratch in the EIT Digital project in 2015 and 2016, which is now freely available on Coursera and has thousands active students.\\ 

\hspace{-2.0cm} \textit{About Simon}\\
I would describe myself as a person who takes the initiative, gets things started and gets things done. 
I have a very good working discipline with regard to time and responsibility, and \textit{I always do the work today instead of leaving it until tomorrow}! 
I always start a task well on time, and I keep the promised timelines whether it is a question of delivering C code, an article, a presentation, course material or a PhD thesis.\\ 
My hobbies are traveling, gardening, skiing, hiking, driving, workout and watching airplanes.

% \section{\mysidestyle Research Summary: \textit{\\Energy Aware \\Software}}
% Energy efficiency is today one of the most important research areas in computer science. 
% At the development of all kinds of systems from mobile phones to laptops, desktops and high capacity servers, a battle to fight energy efficiency is becoming a reality.    
% To fight this problem, systems integrate more and more power management capabilities.
% % Power management has traditionally been an area of research providing hardware solutions or runtime power management in the operating system in form of frequency governors.
% The current problem in power management systems is that the software is unable to communicate with the runtime systems sufficiently.
% This often causes over-allocation of resources leading to energy waste without any performance benefit.
% The reason is that applications are not involved in the power management decisions, nor does any interface between the applications and the runtime system exist. 
% \textit{Energy awareness in application software is therefore non-existent.}
% In my research work, I am creating the link between applications and the runtime system for expressing \textbf{energy awareness}.
% Like using OpenMP \texttt{pragmas} or OpenCL initializations for expressing parallelism, my framework allows the programmer to express energy and power requirement parameters in form of meta-data directly in the application.
% The parameters -- together with a new power management system -- eliminate over-allocation of resources and increase the energy efficiency of the computing system.
% Experiments on real-world platforms have shown up to 50\% lower energy consumption without performance degradation for every-day applications like HD video decoding, by using my methods for energy aware programming.
% % To utilize the energy-aware methodologies, energy-awareness should be a part of the natural development environment from programmer- to language- to compiler- and runtime.
% My goal is to create a tool-chain for energy aware programming usable for both new- and legacy applications in platform domains from IoT embedded platform to mobile phone devices and large many-core server machines.
